 - implement beatiful registration for lifter functions
 - remove X-register search from dsl, and just add aliases for them in model
 - consider to remove explicit sign binary operations.
   as a positive effect - it eliminate syntax cases. as a negative it
   may introduce new bugs, because an expression (low word ra > zero)
   will not have a desired effect. so one will have to assign to a
   signed variable (low word ra) and then compare to zero.
 - implement one or few vector instructions to check that our model
   fits well to this purpose
 - add to model xer register
 - add to model floating point flags (or whatever there is)
 - check move insn - if there is some suitable numbers for registers
   that we didn't use
 - consider update_link_register in branch insns - weird ?
