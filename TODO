 - implement beatiful registration for lifter functions
 - remove X-register search from dsl, and just add aliases for them in model
 - consider to remove explicit sign binary operations.
   as a positive effect - it eliminate syntax cases. as a negative it
   may introduce new bugs, because an expression (low word ra > zero)
   will not have a desired effect. so one will have to assign to a
   signed variable (low word ra) and then compare to zero.
